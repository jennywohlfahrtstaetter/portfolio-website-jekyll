      Thank you for your interest in the topic of data protection. Below, we want to inform you about what happens to your personal data when you visit our website. Personal data includes any information that can be used to identify you personally. In our privacy policy, you will find detailed information about data protection. <br /><br /><strong><br />1. Overview of Data Protection</strong> <br /><br /><strong>Data Collection on Our Website</strong> <br /><em><br /> <strong>Who is responsible for data collection on this website?</strong></em> <br /><br />Data processing on this website is carried out by the website operators. You can find our contact details in the imprint of this website. <br /><br /><em><strong>How do we collect your data?</strong></em> <br /><br />Certain data is collected automatically by IT systems when you visit the website. This mainly includes technical data (e.g., internet browser, operating system, or time of page view). The collection of this data occurs automatically as soon as you visit our website. <br /><br /><em><strong>What do we use your data for?</strong></em> <br /><br />Some of the data is collected to ensure the proper functioning and display of our website. Other data is used to analyze user behavior to continuously improve our website. <br /><em><strong><br />What rights do you have regarding your data?</strong></em> <br /><br />You have the right at any time to obtain free information about the origin, recipients, and purpose of your stored personal data. You also have the right to request the correction, blocking, or deletion of this data. You can contact us at any time with questions regarding data protection. Our contact details can be found in the imprint of this website. Additionally, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority. <br /><br /><em><strong>Analysis Tools and Third-Party Tools</strong></em> <br /><br /> When visiting our website, your browsing behavior may be statistically evaluated. This is primarily done using cookies and so-called analysis programs (Google Analytics). The analysis of your user behavior is usually done anonymously. Your behavior cannot be traced back to you. More details can be found in our privacy policy under the heading “Analysis Tools and Advertising”. <br /><br /><br /><strong>2. General Information and Mandatory Information</strong> <br /><br /><em><strong>Data Protection</strong></em> <br /><br />We take the protection of your personal data very seriously. Therefore, we treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with legal data protection regulations and this privacy policy. <br /><br />When you use our website, various personal data is collected. Personal data refers to data that can be used to identify you personally. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and how we use it. It also reveals how and for what purpose this happens. <br /><br />We would like to point out that data transmission over the internet (e.g., communication via email) can have security gaps. Complete protection of data from access by third parties is not possible. <br /><br /><em><strong>Responsible Party</strong></em> <br /><br />The responsible party for data processing on this website is: <br /><br /> Jennifer Wohlfahrtstätter &amp; Patrick Fuchs Email: <br />hello@onememorypermile.com <br /><br /> A responsible party is someone who alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g., names, email addresses, etc.). <br /><br /><em><strong>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</strong></em> <br /><br />Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit consent. You can withdraw your consent at any time. A simple notification by email to us is sufficient for this. The legality of the data processing carried out up to the point of withdrawal remains unaffected by the withdrawal. <br /><br /><em><strong>Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Relevant Supervisory Authority</strong></em> <br /><br />In the case of a data protection violation, the affected person has the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority. The competent supervisory authority for data protection issues is the Data Protection Authority of the Republic of Austria. <br /><br /><em><strong>Right to Data Portability</strong></em> <br /><br /> You have the right to request that data we process automatically based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract be handed over to you or to a third party in a commonly used, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only occur to the extent technically feasible. <br /><br /><em><strong>SSL Encryption</strong></em> <br /><br /> This site uses SSL encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as inquiries you send to us as the operators of this website. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the change in the browser's address bar from “http://” to “https://” and the lock symbol in your browser's address bar. <br /><br /> When SSL encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties. <br /><em><strong><br />Access, Blocking, Deletion</strong></em> <br /><br />You have the right to free access to your stored personal data, its origin, recipients, and the purpose of data processing, and, if applicable, the right to correction, blocking, or deletion of this data within the framework of applicable legal provisions. For this purpose and for further questions regarding personal data, you can contact us at any time using the contact details provided in the imprint. <br /><br /><br /><strong>3. Data Collection on Our Website</strong> <br /><br /><em><strong>Cookies</strong></em> <br /><br />Our website uses so-called cookies. Cookies do not damage your computer and do not contain viruses. Instead, cookies help to make our offer more user-friendly, effective, and secure. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer system via your internet browser. <br /><br /> Most of the cookies we use are so-called “session cookies”. They are automatically deleted after your visit. Other cookies remain on your device until you delete them. These cookies allow us to recognize your browser on your next visit. <br /><br /> You can set your browser to notify you about cookies and allow cookies only in individual cases. You can also exclude the acceptance of cookies for certain cases or in general, and activate the automatic deletion of cookies when closing the browser. However, please note that disabling cookies may limit the functionality of our website. <br /><br /> Cookies that are necessary for the electronic communication process or to provide certain functions you want are stored based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. Our legitimate interest in storing cookies lies in the technically flawless and optimized provision of our services. Other cookies (e.g., cookies for analyzing your browsing behavior) are dealt with separately in this privacy policy. <br /><br /> Further information can be found in the <a href="/cookie-richtlinie.html">Cookie Policy</a>. <br /><br /><em><strong>Server Log Files</strong></em> <br /><br />The provider of our website automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files that your browser transmits automatically to us. These are: <br /><br />- Browser type and version <br />- Operating system used <br />- Referrer URL <br />- Hostname of the accessing computer <br />- Time of the server request <br />- IP address <br /><br /> A combination of this data with other data sources is not performed. <br /><br /> The basis for data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO, which permits the processing of data for the performance of a contract or pre-contractual measures. <br /><br /><em><strong>Storage of IP Addresses</strong></em> <br /><br />Our comment function stores the IP addresses of users who post comments. Since we only partially review comments on our site before publishing them, we need this data to take action against the author in the event of legal violations such as insults or propaganda. <br /><br /><br /> <strong>4. Social Media</strong> <br /><em><strong><br />Sharing Content on Social Media</strong></em> <br /><br />The content on our pages can be shared in compliance with data protection regulations on social networks such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and Pinterest. Direct contact between the networks and users is only established when the user actively clicks on one of these buttons. <br /><br /> There is no automatic transmission of user data to the operators of these platforms. If you are logged in to one of the social networks, an information window will appear when using the social media buttons from Instagram, Facebook, Google+, Twitter &amp; Pinterest on our website, where you can confirm the text before sending it. <br /><br /> We do not use plugins provided by the social media platforms on our website. Our users can thus share the content of our website in compliance with data protection regulations on social networks without creating complete surfing profiles by the network operators. <br /><br /><em><strong>Instagram</strong></em> <br /><br /> On our website, a plugin is embedded that shows our photos posted on the social media platform Instagram. The provider of Instagram is Instagram Inc., 1601 Willow Road, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA. The plugin does not store any personal data. However, it is possible that your IP address is stored on Instagram’s servers. We embed our Instagram images on our website to keep our readers updated on our current travel destinations. Additionally, displaying our Instagram images helps to provide the most comprehensive and complete presentation of our travel content. This constitutes a legitimate interest under Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. <br /><br /> For more information on how user data is handled, please refer to Instagram's privacy policy at: https://help.instagram.com/155833707900388. <br /><br /><strong><br />5. Analysis Tools and Advertising</strong> <br /><br /><em><strong>Google Analytics 4</strong></em> <br /><br />If you have given your consent, this website uses Google Analytics 4, a web analytics service provided by Google LLC. The responsible entity for users in the EU/EEA and Switzerland is Google Ireland Limited, Google Building Gordon House, 4 Barrow St, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland (“Google”). <br /><br /><em><strong>Type and Purpose of Processing</strong></em> <br /><br />Google Analytics uses cookies to enable an analysis of your use of our websites. The information collected by these cookies about your use of this website is generally transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. <br /><br />In Google Analytics 4, IP anonymization is enabled by default. Due to IP anonymization, your IP address is shortened by Google within the member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address transmitted to a Google server in the USA and then shortened. According to Google, the IP address transmitted by your browser within the scope of Google Analytics is not combined with other data from Google. During your visit to the website, your user behavior is recorded in the form of “events.” Events can include: <br /><br />- Page views <br />- First-time visits to the website <br />- Session start <br />- Visited web pages <br />- Your “click path,” interaction with the website <br />- Scrolls (whenever a user scrolls to the bottom of the page (90%)) <br />- Clicks on external links <br />- Internal search queries <br />- Interaction with videos <br />- File downloads <br />- Viewed/clicked ads <br />- Language settings <br /><br />Additionally, the following information is recorded: <br /><br />- Your approximate location (region) <br />- Date and time of the visit <br />- Your IP address (in shortened form) <br />- Technical information about your browser and the devices you use (e.g., language settings, screen resolution) <br />- Your internet service provider <br />- The referrer URL (the website/advertising medium through which you came to this website) <br /><em><strong><br />Purposes of Processing</strong></em> <br /><br />Google will use this information on behalf of the operator of this website to evaluate your use of the website and to compile reports on website activities. The reports provided by Google Analytics are used to analyze the performance of our website. <br /><br /><em><strong>Recipients</strong></em> <br />Recipients of the data are/can be: <br /><br />- Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland (as a processor according to Art. 28 GDPR) <br />- Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA <br />- Alphabet Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA <br /><br /><em><strong>Transfer to Third Countries</strong></em> <br /><br />For the USA, the European Commission adopted its adequacy decision on July 10, 2023. Google LLC is certified under the EU-US Privacy Framework. Since Google servers are distributed worldwide and transmission to third countries (e.g., Singapore) cannot be completely ruled out, we have also concluded the <a href="https://business.safety.google/adsprocessorterms/sccs/c2p/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EU Standard Contractual Clauses</a> with the provider. <br /><br /><em><strong>Retention Period</strong></em> <br /><br />The data we send and link with cookies are automatically deleted after 2 years. The maximum lifespan of Google Analytics cookies is 2 years. The deletion of data whose retention period has expired occurs automatically once a month. Legal basis <br /><br /><em><strong>Legal Basis</strong></em> <br /><br />The legal basis for this data processing is your consent according to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR and § 25 para. 1 sentence 1 TTDSG. <br /><br /><em><strong>Withdrawal</strong></em> <br /><br />You can withdraw your consent at any time with effect for the future by calling the cookie settings and changing your selection there. The legality of the processing carried out based on the consent up to the point of withdrawal remains unaffected. <br /><br />You can also prevent the storage of cookies altogether by adjusting your browser software accordingly. However, if you configure your browser to reject all cookies, functionality on this and other websites may be limited. Additionally, you can prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) by Google, as well as the processing of this data by Google, by: <br /><br />a. Not giving your consent to the setting of the cookie, or <br />b. Downloading and installing the browser add-on to deactivate Google Analytics <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HERE</a>. <br /><br />Further information on Google Analytics terms of use and data protection at Google can be found at <a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/terms/de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/terms/de/</a> and <a href="https://policies.google.com/?hl=de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://policies.google.com/?hl=de</a>. <br /><br /><em><strong>Order Data Processing</strong></em> <br /><br />We have concluded an order processing agreement with Google and fully implement the requirements of the Austrian Data Protection Authority when using Google Analytics. <br /><br /><strong>6. Links</strong><br /><br /><em><strong>Liability for Content</strong></em> <br />As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with general laws under § 7 para. 1 DDG. According to §§ 8 to 10 DDG, we are, however, not obligated to monitor transmitted or stored external information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activities. Obligations to remove or block the use of information according to general laws remain unaffected. Liability in this respect is only possible from the time we become aware of a specific legal violation. Upon becoming aware of corresponding legal violations, we will promptly remove such content. <br /><br /><em><strong>Liability for Links</strong></em> <br />Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties over whose content we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the linked sites is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was not recognizable at the time of linking. However, a permanent content control of the linked pages without concrete indications of a legal violation is not reasonable. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we will promptly remove such links.<em><br /></em> <br /><em><strong>Copyright</strong></em> <br />The content and works created by the site operators on these pages are subject to German copyright law. Reproduction, editing, distribution, and any form of utilization beyond the limits of copyright law require the written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this site are only permitted for private, non-commercial use. As far as the content on this site was not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are observed. In particular, third-party content is identified as such. If you become aware of a copyright infringement despite this, we ask for an appropriate notice. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we will promptly remove such content.<em><br /></em><strong><br />7. Plugins and Tools</strong> <br /><br /><em><strong>Google Maps</strong></em> <br /><br /> Our website uses the Google Maps plugin. The provider is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. <br /><br />When you visit one of our pages equipped with a Google Map, your IP address is stored on Google’s servers in the USA. As site operators, we have no control over this storage. <br /><br />We embed Google Maps to visualize our travel tips and to provide our readers with the best possible support in planning their trips using interactive maps. The integration of Google Maps on our website thus constitutes a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. <br /><br /> For more information on how user data is handled, please refer to Google's privacy policy at: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de&amp;gl=de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy.</a>
