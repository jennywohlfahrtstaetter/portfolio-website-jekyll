## 2. General Information and Mandatory Information

#### Data Protection
We take the protection of your personal data very seriously. Therefore, we treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the legal data protection regulations and this privacy policy.

When you use our website, various personal data is collected. Personal data refers to data with which you can be personally identified. In this privacy policy, we explain which data we collect and how we use it. It also discloses how and for what purpose this occurs.

We would like to point out that data transmission over the internet (e.g., communication by email) can have security vulnerabilities. Complete protection of data from access by third parties is not possible.

#### Responsible Authority
The responsible authority for data processing on this website is:
Jennifer Wohlfahrtstätter & Patrick Fuchs  
Email: hello@onememorydesign.com

A responsible authority is the person who alone or together with others decides on the purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g., names, email addresses, etc.).

#### Withdrawal of Consent to Data Processing
Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit consent. You can withdraw an already granted consent at any time. For this, an informal notification by email to us is sufficient. The legality of the data processing carried out until the withdrawal remains unaffected by the withdrawal.

#### Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Supervisory Authority
In case of a data protection violation, the affected person has the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority. The supervisory authority responsible for data protection issues is the data protection authority of the Republic of Austria.

#### Right to Data Portability
You have the right to receive data that we process automatically based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract, in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of data to another controller, this will only be done if technically feasible.

#### SSL Encryption
For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as inquiries you send to us as the operator of this website, we use SSL encryption. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the change in the browser's address bar from “http://” to “https://” and the lock symbol in your browser bar.

When SSL encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.

#### Information, Blocking, Deletion
You have the right to receive information about your stored personal data, its origin, and recipients, as well as the purpose of the data processing, and, if applicable, the right to correction, blocking, or deletion of this data, within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, at any time free of charge. For this and other questions regarding personal data, you can always contact us using the contact details provided in the imprint.

## 3. Data Collection on Our Website

#### Cookies
Our website uses so-called cookies. Cookies do not harm your computer and do not contain viruses. Rather, cookies serve to make our offer more user-friendly, efficient, and secure. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer system via your internet browser.

Most of the cookies we use are so-called “session cookies.” They are automatically deleted at the end of your visit. Other cookies remain on your end device until you delete them. These cookies allow us to recognize your browser on your next visit.

You can configure your browser to inform you about the setting of cookies and only allow cookies in individual cases. Furthermore, you can exclude the acceptance of cookies for specific cases or in general, and activate the automatic deletion of cookies when closing your browser. However, we would like to point out that the deactivation of cookies may limit the functionality of our website.

Cookies that are necessary for the electronic communication process or for providing certain functions requested by you will be stored based on Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR. Our legitimate interest in the storage of cookies lies in the technical error-free and optimized provision of our services. Further cookies (e.g., cookies for analyzing your browsing behavior) are dealt with separately in this privacy policy.

Further information can be found in the [Cookie Policy](cookie-policy).

#### Server Log Files
The provider of our website collects and stores information automatically in so-called server log files, which your browser automatically transmits to us. These are:
- Browser type and browser version
- Used operating system
- Referrer URL
- Hostname of the accessing computer
- Time of the server request
- IP address

This data is not merged with other data sources.

The legal basis for data processing is Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, which allows data processing for the performance of a contract or pre-contractual measures.

#### Storage of IP Addresses
Our comment function stores the IP addresses of users who write comments. Since we partially review comments on our page before publishing, we need this data to take action against the author in case of legal violations such as insults or propaganda.

## 4. Social Media

#### Sharing Content via Social Media
The content on our pages can be shared in social networks such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and Pinterest in compliance with data protection regulations. Direct contact between the networks and users is established only when the user actively clicks on one of these buttons.

No automatic data transfer to the operators of these platforms occurs. If you are logged into one of the social networks, an information window appears when using the social media buttons on Instagram, Facebook, Google+, Twitter & Pinterest on our website, in which you can confirm the text before submitting it.

We do not use plugins provided by social media platforms on our website. Our users can thus share the content of our website in social networks in compliance with data protection regulations, without the operators of the networks creating complete browsing profiles.

## 5. Analysis Tools and Advertising

#### Google Analytics 4
If you have given your consent, Google Analytics 4, a web analytics service of Google LLC, is used on this website. The responsible party for users in the EU/EEA and Switzerland is Google Ireland Limited, Google Building Gordon House, 4 Barrow St, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland ("Google").

#### Type and Purpose of Processing
Google Analytics uses cookies that allow an analysis of how you use our websites. The information collected through cookies about your use of this website is usually transferred to and stored on a server of Google in the USA.

For Google Analytics 4, IP address anonymization is enabled by default. Due to IP anonymization, your IP address will be truncated by Google within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a server of Google in the USA and truncated there. According to Google, the IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with other Google data. During your website visit, your user behavior is recorded in the form of "events."  
Events may include:
- Page views
- First visit to the website
- Start of the session
- Visited pages
- Your "click path", interaction with the website
- Scrolls (whenever a user scrolls to the bottom of the page (90%))
- Clicks on external links
- Internal search queries
- Interaction with videos
- File downloads
- Viewed/clicked ads
- Language setting

Additionally, the following is recorded:
- Your approximate location (region)
- Date and time of the visit
- Your IP address (in truncated form)
- Technical information about your browser and devices used (e.g., language setting, screen resolution)
- Your internet provider
- Referrer URL (which website or ad medium led you to this website)

#### Purpose of Processing
On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website and compile reports on website activity. The reports provided by Google Analytics are used to analyze the performance of our website.

#### Recipients
Recipients of the data may include:
- Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland (as a data processor according to Art. 28 GDPR)
- Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA
- Alphabet Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA

#### Transfer to Third Countries
For the USA, the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision on July 10, 2023. Google LLC is certified under the EU-US Privacy Framework. As Google servers are distributed worldwide, and a transfer to third countries (for example, to Singapore) cannot be entirely ruled out, we have also concluded the [EU Standard Contractual Clauses](https://business.safety.google/adsprocessorterms/sccs/c2p/){:target="_blank"} with the provider.

#### Storage Duration
The data we send and link to cookies will be automatically deleted after 2 years. The maximum lifespan of Google Analytics cookies is 2 years. The deletion of data that has reached its retention period occurs automatically once a month.

#### Legal Basis
The legal basis for this data processing is your consent according to Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. a GDPR and § 25 (1) sentence 1 TTDSG.

#### Withdrawal
You can withdraw your consent at any time with effect for the future by calling up the cookie settings and changing your selection there. The lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal remains unaffected.

You can also prevent the storage of cookies by adjusting your browser software settings. However, if you configure your browser to reject all cookies, this may limit functionalities on this and other websites. Additionally, you can prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) by Google, as well as the processing of these data by Google, by:
a. Not giving consent to the setting of the cookie, or
b. Downloading and installing the browser add-on to deactivate Google Analytics [HERE](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en){:target="_blank"}.

For further information from Google, please visit their [Privacy & Terms](https://policies.google.com/?hl=en){:target="_blank"}.

#### Data Processing Agreement
We have concluded a data processing agreement with Google and fully comply with the guidelines of the Austrian Data Protection Authority when using Google Analytics.

## 6. Links

#### Liability for Content
As service providers, we are responsible for our own content on these pages according to § 7 (1) TMG under general law. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, we are not, however, obligated to monitor transmitted or stored external information or to investigate circumstances indicating illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information according to general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the moment we become aware of a specific legal violation. If we become aware of such violations, we will remove the content immediately.

#### Liability for Links
Our offer contains links to external third-party websites, on whose content we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any responsibility for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. No illegal content was detectable at the time of linking. A permanent content control of the linked pages is, however, not reasonable without concrete evidence of a violation of the law. If we become aware of legal violations, we will remove such links immediately. Copyright The content and works created by the site operators on these pages are subject to German copyright law.

#### Copyright
The reproduction, editing, distribution, and any type of utilization outside the limits of copyright law require the written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this site are only permitted for private, non-commercial use. As far as the content on this site was not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are observed. In particular, third-party content is marked accordingly. If you become aware of a copyright violation, we ask for an appropriate notice. Upon notification of legal violations, we will immediately remove such content.

## 7. Plugins and Tools

#### Formspree
We use Formspree, a service that allows us to create and manage forms on our website. When using Formspree, the data you enter into our forms is transmitted to and processed by Formspree. Formspree securely stores this data and makes it available to us so that we can respond to your requests or messages. Your data is stored only as long as necessary for the purpose for which it was collected and is not shared with third parties unless required by law.

By using Calendly, you consent to the processing of your data in accordance with their [Privacy Policy](https://calendly.com/legal/privacy-notice){:target="_blank"} and on [Terms and Conditions](https://calendly.com/legal){:target="_blank"}.

#### Google Fonts

This website uses so-called Google Fonts provided by Google to ensure a consistent display of typefaces. When you access a page, your browser downloads the required fonts into its cache in order to display texts and fonts correctly.

For this purpose, the browser you are using must establish a connection to Google's servers. Through this connection, Google becomes aware that this website was accessed via your IP address. The use of Google Fonts is based on Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the uniform display of typography on the website. If appropriate consent has been obtained, processing will take place solely on the basis of Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR and § 25(1) of the TTDSG, insofar as the consent covers the storage of cookies or access to information on the user's device (e.g., device fingerprinting) as defined by the TTDSG. Consent can be revoked at any time.

If your browser does not support Google Fonts, a default font installed on your computer will be used.

For more information about Google Fonts, please visit https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq and refer to Google's Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de.

The company is certified under the "EU-US Data Privacy Framework" (DPF). The DPF is an agreement between the European Union and the USA that aims to ensure compliance with European data protection standards in data processing in the USA. Every company certified under the DPF commits to adhering to these data protection standards.
